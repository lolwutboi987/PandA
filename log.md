 # 3/18/25, Day 0: The brainstorm
 It was a boring tuesday afternoon. I had nothing to do, and was chatting with my group after the absolute chaos that was scrapyard silicon valley. I was chatting on discord about how it was funny that we brought a 3d printer to the hackathon, untill my friend mentions the infill channel. I browse through the channel, excited for another engineering related thing to do during the vex offseason. One problem: Where do I begin? With Scrapyard SV still on my mind, I think of my ender 3 that we brought and the numerous problems that arised when it came to taking a conventional 3d pritner with you on the go. I decided, Why not make a 3d printer designed for hackathons? (Or any situation that requires rapid protyping). Here's what would make a printer optimal:
 ## Minimized downtime
 One of the annoying things about a 3d printer than  contribute to downtime is:
 - Printer takes forever to heat; especially the bed or a high volume hotend,
 - Bed meshes take FOREVER, since you have to wait for the bed to heatsoak, and the probing takes a very long time.
 - Printer purging/loading takes excessive amounts of time to do.
 - Other wear-based maintenance and basic things like cleaning the nozzle.
 How will PandA solve these problems?
 - 110VAC bed increases bed-heating power
 - Eddy current probes reduce bed meshing times down to several seconds, as opposed to several minutes.
 - Well-Programed GCODE macros can 
## Optimize velocity
