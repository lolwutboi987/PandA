# PandA-RPD
The PortableAndAutomated Rapid-Protyping-Device

A compact solution to rapid prototyping on-the-go. 

Features:
- All-Original CoreXZ kinematics for maximum print speed and acceleration, while tackling common z-axis artifacts caused by leadscrews and ballscrews.
- 300-Watt Ultralight AC Heated Bed for minimal downtime between print protyping.
- BigTreeTech Eddy Duo sensor for lightning-fast bed leveling
- BigTreeTech SKR MINI E3 V3 for silent, yet high performance operation.
- Driven by 3 42-48 Stepper motors, granting unprecedented torque and velocity in all directions.
- Dual 5020 blowers with optimized ducts allow for unprecedented cooling.
- 150X150mm build volume allows for Ample build volumes.
- Custom Carbon Fiber Y-Axis allows for acceleration values never seen on a bedsligner.
